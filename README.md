Made in Autumn 2023, this is my first React self-learned small project. 

1. In main branch, the last-version project is saved.
2. In other branches, some learning points of different versions are also quite useful. Check the learning points by each README file. 


3. useFetch, customized hook

4. react-router-dom

5. import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
    - 5.1 <Link to ="/">Home</Link>
